[Brief Introduction]

I am a student at Northern Kentucky University with a major in Cybersecurity. I have a background in biological science from my time at the University of Cincinnati and finance as I am working as a stockbroker at a local financial institution. I have a profound interest in technology and solving complex problems related to technology and mathematics.
